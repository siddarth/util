Semiotics
n. (used with a sing. verb)
The theory and study of signs and symbols

Semiotics is a utility to set up symlinks from a directory to another with the
ability to add suffixes and prefixes to the filenames in the new directory.

It attempts to tackle the issue of being able to carry around configurations
in a sane manner. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a gem that can pull from
git repos, and update dot files like your vimrc, etc.

Warning:
Code is ugly, untested, and severely Dayquil-induced.
I can provide no guarantees about the workings (seems fine when I ran some
simple tests). It probably can also use some (a lot of) refactoring.
